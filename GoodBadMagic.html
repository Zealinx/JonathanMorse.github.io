									<h1>GoodBadMagic</h1>
									<p>A 2D Top-Down Shooter developed in a custom engine and set in a cartoony medieval castle. You play as a lich who has been captured by the evil knights who inhabit the castle. You must escort your newfound goblin ally to the exit, protecting him from the knights with your necrotic powers.</p>

								<p>On this project, I worked on developing the AI behaviors for the Enemies, as well as the Ally character. The Enemies had a simple tracking behavior, mainly looking to take down the Player's Ally. If they're nowhere to be found, then they'll attack the player. In retrospect, I would have more than one AI for different Enemy types. Some that go after the Ally, some that go after the Player, and one that would decide based on the current situation. In its current state, there is no real danger to the player if they keep their distance. </p>

								<p>For the Ally behavior, they are set to travel down a pre-defined track based on a second tilemap, separate from the level. Once they get injured, they switch to a crying state and stop moving until they are healed by the player. If I were to recreate this behavior, I think I would implement a pathfinding algorithm and not require a separate tilemap just for the pathing. That way, more dynamic levels that change as you play them could be implemented.</p>
								
								<p>One thing that I worked on in the project was implementing a system that could read in tile maps that were exported from Tiled. This way, our designers were able to create a level and then seamlessly have it imported into our custom engine. For the most part, I believe this system still holds up. If I were to remake it, I would split it into more modular systems than have everything in one system, but that's the hindsight I can have after gaining more experience.</p>
								
								<p>Although it could be better, I did implement the Physics System for the project. The main issue with the system was the Collision Detection. It was a naive implementation at a time when I didn't know enough about what I was doing to make it well. If I were to redo it, I would implement a form of the GJK algorithm for a more accurate and efficient system.</p>

								<p>I crafted a 2D Animation System that allowed our artist to create 2D sprite sheet animations for all of the characters in our project. Looking back, it was a relatively simple system, but it did allow for us to modify the speed at which the animation was played. </p>
								
								<i>Starting with the good, we did successfully create a game in a custom engine. Also, this was the first time I successfully implemented and Animation System! This project, however, was predominantly a series of problem after problem that resulted in a product I can't entirely say that I'm proud of. However, with every failure comes a chance to learn, and I can confidently say that I walked away from this project learning a lot about how to work well on an interdisciplinary team. </i>
