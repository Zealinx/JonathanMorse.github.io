									<h1>Vanquisher</h1>
									<p> A 3D Action game developed in Unity where you take control of a dishonored knight, looking for vengeance against the king he once protected. Utilize a combo system to deftly take down wave after wave of enemies, building up your combo meter to unleash powerful finishers.</p>

								<p>On this project, I developed the backend for the combo system. Specifically, I created a system that would modify the player's power as they built up their combo counter. I also created the framework for the finishers, keeping track of the number of hits the player gets to build up to three finisher points that they could spend on stronger moves.</p>

								<p>I also implemented the UI elements for this project, including the combo meter, the finisher points, and all of the tutorial pop-ups that would appear as the player runs through the game.</p>

								<p>Along with the UI, I created a system that manages the settings for the game. Also, I created a system that would keep track of whether the player was using Keyboard and Mouse or Controller and changed the UI icons accordingly.</p>
								<i>This was the first project I ever developed in Unity and looking back, almost everything I did could've been done better with the knowledge I have now. However, this being my first foray into the world of Unity, my main goal for this project was to learn as much as I could. On that front, I'd say this project was a massive success! Other than that, this was the first project where I was the technical lead. Although things didn't go as smoothly as I would have liked, I was able to walk away with the knowledge of what makes a successful Tech Lead and a successful team.</i>
